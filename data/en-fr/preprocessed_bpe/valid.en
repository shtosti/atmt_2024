The girl saw it , too .
Nobody was listening to the speech .
I &apos;ll be right behind you .

Last night I tos@@ sed my cookies .

This is always the way it has been .
Some people are just weird .

Everyone is unique .
I hear music .
We really enjoyed our@@ selves .

Tom almost always ignor@@ es my advice .
I want you to lay back and rela@@ x .
That &apos;ll make me happy .
Look !
Why don &apos;t we go out and get drunk ?
I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re busy . Please help me now .
I wanted to speak with you first .
This room is cold .
The watch doesn &apos;t work .
I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;d noti@@ ced .

If there &apos;s anything I can do to help , please let me know .
I have a feeling you &apos;ll be a very good lawyer .
Some people are reading some magazines on the train .

My father was sad for the whole day as he had lost his w@@ all@@ et .
I don &apos;t care how much you say you love me . I know your feelings for her haven &apos;t changed .
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble .
What the fuck is going on here ?
The o@@ st@@ rich has wings , but it cannot fly .
I was a bit disappointed .
I lost your phone number .
A rope was thro@@ wn into the water .
It being Sunday , the shop was closed .

How many children do you have ?
It wouldn &apos;t surprise me .
Are you seriously thinking about not going ?

Thank you very much .

I &apos;ve got work to do here .
I &apos;ve enjoyed talking to you .
Her job is to type .
Tom was abducted .
You can &apos;t dance , can you ?
I accept your apo@@ logy .
Should I be talking to Tom ?
I need to know where you are .
What did I say yesterday ?
He speaks as if he were an expert .
We have a good team and everyone knows it .
I &apos;m watching the market closely .
I have no imagination .
She is good at skiing .
Keep driving .
I don &apos;t need your help anymore .

I liked working with you .
Go@@ od@@ night .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
He re@@ je@@ cted our offer .
Tom found a job as a mechan@@ ic .
I &apos;ll have a nap after lunch .
If he asks me that question , I won &apos;t answer .
I &apos;m not good @-@ looking .
Were you awake at 2 : 30 last night ?
Why don &apos;t you stay a while ?
He ran to his mother in the library .
Some water , please .
Would you please slow down ?
There &apos;s room inside .
Tom was reading a book while listening to music .
Tom needed your help .
We &apos;re all in this together .
May I try it on ?
Close your eyes and tell me what you hear .
How does Tom plan to help ?
He &apos;s addicted to j@@ unk food .
You &apos;re all alone .
They approve .
We &apos;re ready to leave .
I can drive to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of gas .
Why don &apos;t you pull over ?
Why don &apos;t you meet me out front in a few minutes ?
Sami feels so scared .
It is necessary for you to stop smoking .
I &apos;ve never come across such a strange case .
The company has hard and fast rules against lat@@ eness .
You gotta get more organized .
She &apos;s a yo@@ g@@ a instru@@ ctor .
Nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jokes .
It &apos;s hard to do that .
Once a teacher , always a teacher .
Tom was playing golf that morning .
Does your dog bite ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
Bre@@ a@@ the , dam@@ n you !
What he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I &apos;m not your servant .
I don &apos;t know whether to cry or to laugh .
How come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
What did you do with that ?
Ad@@ ding up numbers is very up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
Can I make copies ?
You won &apos;t die today .
I hid it somewhere .
Sami has been sick .
Are you still upset about what happened ?
She used mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of butter .
I &apos;ll drive you somewhere .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
We have to learn all the songs before the end of the week .
Would you like to visit the city ?
This guy &apos;s great at pit@@ ching cur@@ ve@@ balls .
One weekend all of the ho@@ tels in the city were full because there was a large conven@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
We still have a few weeks left .
She got all flu@@ st@@ ered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
There &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
That hat becomes you .
How long does it take to walk from here to the city hall ?
He dream@@ ed about his home .
They have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .
He was leaving then .
I &apos;ll be home by midnight at the lat@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
Come again ?
I saw the cake you made .
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in Oc@@ to@@ ber .
Where are your friends going ?
As the door slid open , he almost fell onto the plat@@ form .
Can you use a computer ?
That &apos;s a lot of cash .
He &apos;s not a bad person .
If I tell him the truth , she will never forgive me .
You should have seen her .
Some day we &apos;ll take a trip to India .
What time do you want me to pick you up ?
You got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t walk anymore .
I@@ ran is not I@@ ra@@ q .
His deb@@ ts amount to two milli@@ on dollars .
Tom &apos;s eyes were full of tears .
What is today &apos;s date ?
I &apos;ve missed you so much , Tom .
Should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to fear .
I just inven@@ ted a new word @-@ pro@@ ces@@ sor en@@ ab@@ ling to pronounce them back@@ wards .
The old man started to laugh s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m applying for a job .
Who will correct my mistakes ?
Do you think it was easy for me ?
I scre@@ amed but nobody could hear me .
Can anyone drive ?
I am very ill at ease with strangers .
Do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
Two weeks have passed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
Don &apos;t look !
Why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass guitar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her behavior .
Any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
They admitted that they &apos;d lied .
I don &apos;t like swimming in po@@ ols .
Can you understand the meaning of this sentence ?
The man was hiding in a den@@ se forest .
I know that this is weird .
That would make sense .
No one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ blings .
What &apos;s the gold@@ en rule ?
He can hardly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ ended .
We can help you .
Are you involved in politi@@ cs ?
B@@ low out the cand@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t entirely sure myself .
You don &apos;t have to lie .
It was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
The truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experience necessary .
How do you stop this ?
You have too many ir@@ ons in the fire .
But it &apos;s me who should thank you .
He came while I was still asleep .
I took over the business from Father .
O@@ il is expensive .
Where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
Do you know who we are ?
It &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan announ@@ ced that he and Linda were getting divorced .
I have a vi@@ sa .
It will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you .
What &apos;s with the luggage ?
Something is asked of me .
It &apos;s like being a kid in a candy store .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good subject .
You really speak French well .
For example , more people are choo@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
Are you seriously thinking about going ?
It was a pleasure meeting you , Tom .
If you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll die .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I ran outside and the door locked itself behind me .
It would be coun@@ ter @-@ productive to do such a thing .
What do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting impati@@ ently .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a pan@@ the@@ ist .
I like both science and math .
We &apos;re not certain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has reques@@ ted my assistance .
Do you want to get us both killed ?
They all speak French .
Why are you so good at expl@@ aining things ?
No one will stop me .
I &apos;m a trai@@ ne@@ e .
How much are you being paid to do this ?
She was loved by everybody in the village .
Where do you train your students ?
Have you seen my camera ?
I hear you were gr@@ ounded .
This book is too large to go in my pocket .
Could you please over@@ look it this time ?
When I was your age , I had a boyfriend .
I hate that guy .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
He borrowed the car from his friend .
This TV was made in China .
I feel sick every morning .
You should know yourself .
He took this photo .
Would you like to read this magazine ?
He took charge of the firm after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French .
I filled up the vase with water .
It doesn &apos;t matter who says that , it &apos;s not true .
This is how I made it .
Do you know how to play chess ?
This bicycle is mine . Y@@ ours is over there .
It &apos;s an emergency !
For me , the real world is just a fi@@ ction .
Speaking of films , why not go to the cinema tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
Will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
Any@@ thing you want , my dear .
She attracted me at first sight .
That is the fun@@ ni@@ est joke that I have ever heard .
He promised to pro@@ vide information .
I &apos;m taking care of it . You can rela@@ x . You can rely on me .
Are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spoken to your French teacher and he says you &apos;re doing well in his class .
Everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
She likes to go to the library .
Everyone is waiting in the other room .
It matters to me .
The cold air re@@ viv@@ ed Tom .
Are you out of your mind ?
She tempted him .
Everyone can make a difference in their own lives and ther@@ e@@ by colle@@ cti@@ vely make the world a better place for themselves and others around them .
You &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
Let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
You &apos;d better stay with me .
Once upon a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more countries than anyone in the world .
Can you come to the party ?
Don &apos;t s@@ plash me !
Tom hardly spoke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
There &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ ques made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ non .
Everyone is free to contribute .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
They made sure nobody could see them .
A guy nearly ran into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished business .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ illing .
Do you think that &apos;s true ?
If you would be a good read@@ er , read ; if a writer , write .
I hate those spi@@ ders . They &apos;re always there to freak me out when I &apos;m cle@@ an@@ ing .
No such person exi@@ sts .
Do your best !
I gave up hope .
She advised him to cut down on smoking .
No matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
She told him a joke .
Can you put the children to bed ?
Marie &apos;s hiding something from me .
Did you go to Tom &apos;s party last Saturday ?
He wrote a novel based on anci@@ ent my@@ ths .
Tom went rock clim@@ bing .
She didn &apos;t like this game .
They &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
Don &apos;t touch this !
You &apos;ve been warned .
He plays the piano very well .
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicycle ?
She has good ideas .
What a horrible thing !
We have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
You &apos;re a trai@@ tor .
We take risks all the time .
Z@@ ai@@ lai@@ ba B@@ ar is hi@@ ring wai@@ ters ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right arm .
I tried flying from the top of the tree .
This pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the grass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
Open the door .
It &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
We assume that he is honest .
Are you all right ?
Whi@@ ch@@ ever road you may take , it will lead to the station .
If I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
He makes himself ac@@ ces@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ sel .
I &apos;m sorry I misunder@@ stood you .
Where can I find a taxi ?
She &apos;s going through a mid@@ life crisis .
The rescued refu@@ ge@@ es were long@@ ing for free@@ dom .
Stop suc@@ king up to the teacher .
Re@@ pe@@ ate@@ dly s@@ lam@@ ming the clu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how managed to get the clu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ engag@@ ed so I could just about drive for the time being .
They did not believe me .
We know you &apos;re interested .
The house is bur@@ ning !
We consider Tom honest .
I &apos;ll give you a simple example .
W@@ in@@ ds from the sea are moi@@ st .
We have arrived safe and sound .
We are going to leave tomorrow .
Mr W@@ il@@ son is proud of his house .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
The meeting will be held regard@@ less of the weather .
In the Ar@@ cti@@ c there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
She &apos;s young , naive and in@@ experienced .
