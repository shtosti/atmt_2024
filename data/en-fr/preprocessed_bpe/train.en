You should stay in the hospital for tre@@ at@@ ment .
Could you please tell me again who your father is ?
Do you have a back@@ up plan ?
Everyone started laughing .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
I even wrote a letter to her .
What &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
We have way too much work to do .
He is deeply att@@ ached to her .
He is not such a nasty fellow as you think .
I &apos;m happy you liked it .
We have come a long way .
This is my favourite subject .
How many languages are spoken wor@@ l@@ d@@ wide ?
In a manner of speaking , yes .
Now drink up .
I assure you this is about much more than money .
Did you forget to do your homework ?
I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bike .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
He is hated by all .
I don &apos;t bite .
This will only take a second .
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday .
We lost .
He went into re@@ ha@@ b .
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost .
He &apos;s feeling much better .
Tom sings in a church choir .
He felt uneasy in his father &apos;s presence .
Am I the only one who didn &apos;t understand what was going on ?
The storm did great damage to her property .
I &apos;m sorry for the pain I caused you and your family .
I lost my wife in a traffic accident .
Nothing has gone right all day .
Make has@@ te .
You &apos;re very timid .
We &apos;re all in this together .
He dropped the ancho@@ vies .
You &apos;re out of your mind .
Do you mind if we come in ?
It &apos;s very cold , this winter !
This is bad .
As far as I am concerned , I am not against your opinion .
He seldom orders anything new .
I quite co@@ ttoned on to that man .
He came running .
He is not himself today .
It &apos;s not going to be easy to finish this job on time .
This is going to happen a lot from now on .
This oil well has been suc@@ ked dry .
That &apos;s told him !
Dan drag@@ ged Linda out of the house and threw her in the street .
I &apos;m not tired right now .
You don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
Now you listen to me !
You &apos;ll feel better in a few hours .
I &apos;m very lazy .
You &apos;re nuts !
Tom deserves punishment .
What do you think happened to Tom ?
It &apos;s like being in a candy store .
This evening we will go to church .
It &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
There were a lot of girls at the party .
Come to help me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of ghosts .
He is well @-@ liked .
I added his name to the list .
Thank you for your efforts .
I need to see you in my office .
The costs are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
Don &apos;t mess with me !
I feel very str@@ ong@@ ly about that .
She owes me money .
Can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
This little girl lives in Brazil .
I feel like someone just walked over my gr@@ ave .
Give me chapter and verse .
Can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
Our garden produced an abundance of cabb@@ ages last year .
Why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t stand this hot weather .
Give us the details .
She witn@@ essed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was trapped in a vi@@ cious cir@@ cle .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s secrets .

Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
It will be ready soon .
There &apos;s a compar@@ ati@@ vely large cinema complex inside the m@@ all .
Who &apos;s hiding behind the curtain ?
Ob@@ viously , you volunteered .
See life in terms of power .
The weather is good .
Do you really want to win ?
Most of them urged him to take the job .
Sami came to give Layla her gift .
Nothing was funny .
I never loved you .
Let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is boring , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
We are living through a bio@@ di@@ versity crisis .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
Really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
He &apos;s working at his English .
They live on the floor bene@@ ath .
There is a pond in the middle of the park .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
She speaks too much .
No taxi stopped .
You must not stop on the hard shoulder to go to the toilet .
Something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets upset easily .
This man is a leg@@ end .
Enjoy your meal ! Did you already start ?
You &apos;re a snob .
I figured I could count on you .
We &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
May I put it down here ?
If Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
At what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .
She is always forgetting my phone number .
What has become of him since then ?
She doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
You would like it .
The price is reas@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ stri@@ es increas@@ ing@@ ly became g@@ eared for outer space .

My legs are weak .
She doesn &apos;t know the ti@@ tle of the book you &apos;re talking about .
Let &apos;s talk shop for a while .
She poured the milk into a bow@@ l .
Run hot water into the bath .
She treated me badly .
May I have your order , please ?
The radio is a bit loud .
Mary is a y@@ od@@ eler .
He kept on laughing at me .
I could tell you about be@@ e@@ keeping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bo@@ re you .
Don &apos;t all speak at once .
It was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at furniture we can &apos;t afford .
He wants you to come home .
You &apos;re early .
I found the empty box .
She made him rich .
He was standing at the top of the mountain .
She le@@ aned towards me .
This is what I wanted .
You remind me of myself when I was your age .
These pieces of furniture are not for sale .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
Please close the door behind you .
Have you made a list yet ?
Without oxyg@@ en , all animals would have disappeared long ago .
Why &apos;s Tom still here ?
We need money .
It &apos;s my fault , not yours .
No one is amused .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
While we were having tea , there was an earthquake .
Either they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
What is in your hands ?
We need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the market .
It was one of the most rewar@@ ding experiences of my life .
He is responsible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ dering doing that .
I can think of several reasons .
You might get hurt .
You &apos;re the only one who can help .
When was the last time you talked to Tom ?
Do you really think Tom is happy ?
You &apos;ve been infe@@ cted .
There were six sheep in the field .
Are you thinking about getting a job ?

My brain is fried .
A new road is under construction .
Tom had a little accident .
They kept drinking .
Did you read it entirely ?
She &apos;s two years younger than him .
Our teacher often overlooked his name on the list .
Tom still owes me a lot of money .
Get the hell out my way !
Be careful !
The population of Japan is larger than that of New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
The price rose .
The pain has less@@ ened a little .
I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me .
Any chance you know where I put my keys ?
That &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
You &apos;re all set ?
That &apos;s absolute nonsense !
The teacher punished her students for using bad words .
How can you ac@@ cuse me of such a thing ? I would never lay a hand on my child .
Tom is thirsty .
He has a Sou@@ thern accent .
Don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
The problem is thei@@ rs .
In times of crisis one should never ide@@ ali@@ se the past .

I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the cab .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
We get together once a year .
That was Tom &apos;s cousin .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
No one has ever seen God .
Some teachers have a great effect on their students .
We &apos;re old friends .
We avoid talking about politi@@ cs .
I am not available .
Do you believe in Christi@@ an@@ ity ?
None of these cars are mine .
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office .
You still have a lot to learn .
I want to get back .
I &apos;m sorry that I couldn &apos;t live up to your expectations .
You can go if you want to .
I am convinced that he is innocent .
Do all of you speak French ?
Is this wine from Argent@@ ina ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
There &apos;s no wind today .
There were no fen@@ ces on the great pl@@ ains .

Painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . When you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .

F@@ o@@ od is necessary for life .
That sounds good !
We char@@ tered a bus .
As@@ k me again some other time .

You &apos;ve om@@ itted the pre@@ position in this sentence .
Enjoy yourself to the fu@@ ll@@ est .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live .
Don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bored . Let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom intended to do that .
The firm has its head office in Osaka .
Today , I was with a friend at the swimming pool .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him sweep the floor .
I don &apos;t have those answers .

Can we get some help ?
You must take advantage of the opportunity .
I opened a bottle of red wine .
You have a great imagination .
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him .
She &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
You &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .

I can not afford to buy a used car .
We caught him red @-@ handed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
In about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am asking you for patience .
It &apos;ll be hard to find a replac@@ ement for him .
It &apos;s calm .
She was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same decision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large bedroom .
Let the cat out .
I finally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ erever you want me to go .
It is less cold today than it was yesterday .
There have been a lot of complaints about the way Tom behav@@ es .
We &apos;re not invited .
You need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this command in order to dis@@ play only the lines with &quot; foo &quot; inside .
He has a daughter who is very pretty .
Don &apos;t throw the ball near the windows .
The Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ net inside .
That &apos;s just what I needed .
Promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
We want further information .
I could hardly endure the pain .
Don &apos;t back away .
This doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful butter@@ fly .
French was the language of diplom@@ acy .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
What do you love ? What do you hate ?
How much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
How could I lie to you ?
He was a Fren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his accent .
I will never understand .
We &apos;ll respond .
As my father and my grandfather have many si@@ blings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
Did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
My father does not eat much fruit .
The ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an irregular conjug@@ ation in all languages .
Do you want me to repeat the question ?
Do I have to go now ?
A home is more than a mere building .
Have you already eaten ?
It &apos;s really awesome .
He always takes L√©a on his lap to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true warrior .
Tom needs lots of courage and perseverance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
It must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
Thank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
Don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who barks , but be afraid of the one who is silent and w@@ ags its tail .
What did you just say ?
They make a great team .
The separatists think that I &apos;m kidding .
The bicycle is mine .
We think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am applying for a job .
That &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some peanuts .
I use the Internet as a resour@@ ce for my res@@ earch .
He said he was poor .
She thinks about him all the time .
He has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
This drawing took me five minutes , but I took sixty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your rules .
I didn &apos;t stop .
She took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
How &apos;s everybody doing ?
We &apos;re wasting time .
What did you get hit with ?
C@@ ars are expensive .
They were not impressed .
To tell the truth , I drove my father &apos;s car without his permission .
He is Japanese to the bone .
We gotta have all the data in there .
She doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive engagement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
You know what you must do .
He is twice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
Is this what you were looking for ?
Write in the date yourself .
There is no hope .
Cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an architect , right ?
Were you busy ?
I defeated the warrior .
You are not the only one responsible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to travel with only one suitcase .
You &apos;re wasting both of our time .
Ear@@ ly explor@@ ers used the stars for nav@@ ig@@ ation .
His salary is too low to support his family on .
This is a very time @-@ consu@@ ming task .

Who asked you to do that ?
Have a piece of pie .
Long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
Let &apos;s walk a little faster .
I know exactly where I am .
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a huge mistake .
Breakfast is served .
This is illegal .
I &apos;m not in the mood to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye ?
We managed to swim across the river .
Mary wants to bre@@ ast@@ feed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
Who is he talking to ?
What &apos;s the best cure for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
Would you mind speaking more slowly ?
Do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mistake .
The pa@@ trol@@ man mo@@ tioned me to pull over .
I &apos;ll send you a postcard .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
There &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
You should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
Don &apos;t worry . It &apos;s easy .
It &apos;s against the law .
She has no less than ten children .
All that g@@ list@@ ers is not gold .
One of the gu@@ ards is dead .
You owe it to yourself to do it .
Parents must pro@@ vide their children with proper food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
Don &apos;t beat about the bush .
Would you like to sleep a little longer ?
You are supposed to obey the law .
Whatever you do , don &apos;t push that button .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re wearing .
Are you accus@@ ing me of cheating ?
You can &apos;t drive now . You &apos;ve been drinking .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t resist .
&quot; Does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; No , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
This house is mine .
We were very careful .
I think it &apos;s OK .
Follow your heart , for it never lies .
Do you have any small change ?
Don &apos;t stare at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
My father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
Why did you come home so late ?
The contract is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and celebrate .
According to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have nine lives .
He was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to Spain on holiday .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
This broken vase cannot be repaired .
We must have faith in the president .

We had to less@@ en the impact of the errati@@ c supplies .
He has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
Do whatever you like .

We cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answered the phone .
Tom was watching him sow salad .
If you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; Should I mea@@ sure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; You can ey@@ eball it if you want . &quot;
S@@ ign this .

You must be cau@@ tious .

He &apos;s very polite .
Pickpockets may operate in this area .
This hat is too small . Please show me another one .

We need to remember that .
We must talk her out of this fo@@ o@@ lish plan .
Yes , as far as I know .
I was tr@@ es@@ passing .
It &apos;s cold outside .
Please beat the eggs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ re@@ alistic to expect Tom to do that .
A whale is a mammal .
I wrote down his phone number on a scr@@ ap of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curio@@ sity .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
Inspi@@ red by her teachers , Pharamp is going to start her sol@@ ar career tomorrow .

Americans eat special foods on Thanksgiving .
We &apos;ve had a lot of complaints about how you treat your class@@ mat@@ es .

It is not you but her that he wants to marry .
That made me very sad .

Tom can &apos;t help .
You &apos;re losing .

Oh you poor little thing .
He jumped into the water .

Every movement is painful .

We &apos;re ready now .

I don &apos;t think Tom can play the trumpet .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I owe you .
The less we think , the more we talk .

I am awkward with numbers .
Do you have any idea who did this ?
I built this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .

Everyone looks worried .
I object to her going there alone .
You &apos;re almost right .
Are you going to tell him ?
You &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
Tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
We call a sandwich &quot; Butterbrot . &quot;
Many young people are out of work in the country .

Last winter , I went skiing in Canada .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
He said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
This sofa can seat three people easily .
Keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
Don &apos;t expect anyone to help you .
Is the dog swimming ?
Please prepare for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel uneasy without my notebook .
That makes things clear .
You are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
Are you married or single ? Do you live alone or are you in a relation@@ ship ?
The sky is clear . Not a cloud in sight .
I &apos;m not stopping you .
Pe@@ eing sitting down is not all that bad .
Check these out .
Is he kind to you ?
We always have enough time if we use it correctly .
Tom is as tall as any student in his class is .
As yet , everything has been going well .
Guess what happened to me .
Your future begins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this lake .
Everybody knows his name .
Your sister &apos;s sleeping .
You &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
An enormous space station ori@@ biting around Jupiter overlooked the rainbow stri@@ pes of the gas giant .
The injured were removed from the scene .
The train is arriving !
I &apos;ll pay you .
She was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cure for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
They are happy with the result .
Do not be shy . Your pronunciation is more or less correct .
The air was humi@@ d and lu@@ ke@@ warm .
Of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day .
She is as flat as a panc@@ ake .
This article is more interesting than the previous one .
Do you hit your children ?
Beau@@ ty pleas@@ es the eyes , kindness en@@ ch@@ ants the soul .
Our plan went wrong from the beginning .
I don &apos;t enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around .
This is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba .
Do you still need tea ?
A child should not get more spending money than is necessary .
The pizza is cold .
&quot; Are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; So I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his sudden appearance .
No one could deny this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional baseball game .
Tom &apos;s innocent .
Everyone gathered together for the picture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .

He asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
We want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for repro@@ aching you .
Does Tom still rely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted clarification .
Let &apos;s worry about that later .
He hurt his finger with a nee@@ dle .
She did her best to rescue him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
This job gives me the hum@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
The pro@@ p@@ he@@ cy came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
Have a nice weekend !
&quot; So , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to repeat a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; stories . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
Not all geniuses are engineers , but all engineers are geniuses . The set of all engineers is thus an , un@@ fortunately proper , sub@@ set of all geniuses .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom ignored our advice .
We will be done in at most an hour .
I see her laughing and joking with them .
He was staring at her c@@ leav@@ age .
We &apos;re finished already .
We &apos;re un@@ related .
It &apos;s mis@@ lea@@ ding .
The only one who can solve this problem is you .
What a beautiful rainbow !
You &apos;re a nervous wreck .
Are you good at keeping secrets ?
Try hard to hold it tight !
Do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
You don &apos;t sound entirely convinced .
The boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
You aren &apos;t looking .
Are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
It &apos;s a quarter to two .
Can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
She was on the scene of the crime .
It makes no fucking sense .
His eyes were smiling behind his glasses .
Miss Sato is the president &apos;s new secretary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
When is something art ?
Please make five copies of this document .
Do you have your pills ?
It sno@@ wed yesterday .
Don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at least thirty minutes ago .
It &apos;s not supposed to happen .
He hit me twice .
Help me , please .
I &apos;ve never gotten a speeding ticket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
A fish leaped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
It &apos;s said that nothing is more precious than time .
Are there any bags in this shop ?
Hurry up , girls .
You &apos;ll be ready .
That was very rude .

There is nothing like sleep .
Your watch is ten minutes slow .
I am a student at Oxford University .
You must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
It will snow tomorrow .
You &apos;re too naive .
His beard was thick and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
We &apos;re ashamed of our father &apos;s poverty .
That &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for months .
What year were you born ?
Please drop in when you happen to be in the neighborhood .
He is eager to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
We &apos;re both witn@@ esses .
You &apos;ll feel better after a bath .
You don &apos;t have permission to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
All took part in the negoti@@ ations .
His father won &apos;t come . He &apos;s very busy .
The patient was discharged from hospital .
Do you think Tom can return ?
I have no money to buy the dictionary .
Sami refused to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I returned to Japan .
She visited the old man in the hospital every day but Sunday .
She came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese .
Please take your time before deciding what to do .
I was abducted and im@@ pregn@@ ated by wol@@ ves who land@@ ed their flying s@@ auc@@ er in my bac@@ ky@@ ard .
Why did God create the universe ?
P@@ ass me the sugar , please .
That was cool .
Is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
There was a heavy rain last night .
Let her go .
There &apos;s been another accident .
Didn &apos;t I mention that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
The man was young .
Anyone can do it .
He is still having doubts .
They like English .
L@@ ist@@ en to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of Kakongo .
This dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
She wore a red bl@@ ouse .
I stayed home for a week .
You may be right .
Al@@ ways .
That &apos;s soft .
The town was full of activity .
Leave him alone .
I had no intention of doing so .
The Earth and Sun are just tiny do@@ ts among the billi@@ ons of stars in the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
I suggest we go out for a drink .
Maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
Do you recognize the man in this photo ?
I want to join your team .
Don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat scratching at the window .
There is a cafeteria in the university .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
And who was the other ?
They have an extra bed .
You should take care of yourselves .
Be kind to little animals .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
Something is s@@ lowing down my computer .
My computer crashed and now it won &apos;t start up .
When the desire for leisure is stronger than the other urges , leisure w@@ ins .
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain . Are you really already exhausted ?
Few students can read Latin .
How many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I finally found a use for this old thing .
I want to warm myself .
You must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bother you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admire your determination .
They all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can persuade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
Do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay single .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer vacation .
I made a pot roast .
Is she still single ?
She is not as beautiful as her older sister .
He &apos;s rich as Cro@@ es@@ us .
Don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
Why does Tom want this information ?
What would you say ?
Whoever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
He bought a do@@ zen eggs .
You misunder@@ stood me .
I don &apos;t know either of his brothers .
You &apos;re very busy .
They will hold talks tomorrow .
Did you write that ?
I wanted to protect you .
We asked our teacher : &quot; Where will the wedding be held ? &quot;
Only a miracle may get him out of it .
Can I see your driver &apos;s license ?
This should solve all your problems .
The man reading a newspaper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
Did you have any luck ?
I &apos;m a stranger here .
Someone threw a rock at him .
He kissed me on the forehead .
Maria didn &apos;t suspect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with whom she had been correspon@@ ding for months over the Internet and whom she secre@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was actually a super @-@ intelligent squirrel .
I &apos;m still at school .
How could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 27 .
How did you get interested in art ?
A dog seldom b@@ ites unless it is attacked .
It &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom main@@ t@@ ained that he was innocent .
He is a man who is fond of ceremony .
If only you &apos;d thought of that before shooting your big mouth off .
He is very afraid of dogs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
That is ordinary @-@ looking .
You look pale as a ghost .
C@@ atch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Can you help look after the kids ?
P@@ h@@ iloso@@ phy is often regarded as difficult .
The radio doesn &apos;t work .
He died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
Let &apos;s re@@ consider the problem .
Can you help us ?
We did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time .
The space bar is an alphanu@@ mer@@ ical ke@@ y@@ board &apos;s key .
That job is impossible for me to do .
There is much sugar in this black box .
Our mother had no choice but to make dinner with leftovers .
These two lines cut across each other at right angles .
She doesn &apos;t care how she dresses .
I hate this game .
He &apos;s smart , handsome and polite .
Don &apos;t put all your eggs in one basket .
They got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
When I was in New York , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apologize for the way I acted last night .
May you be touched by His No@@ o@@ dly Ap@@ pend@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
Yes , but they are a lot of work .
She almost fai@@ nted .
How much is the express ?
My father isn &apos;t at home .
My book is not there .
Only then did I realize what he meant .
Why did you buy another car ?
Where did everybody go ?
It &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
You have lots of phones .
Keep your eye on the ball .
I burned my hand with an iron .
That &apos;s impossible .
We love our mother almost without kno@@ wing it , without feeling it , as it is as natural as to live .
It scared me .
When I &apos;m hot , a glass of cool water really refres@@ hes me .
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is ?
The st@@ ew smells delicious .
Tom talks very fast .
Please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; Why is your room p@@ ink , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
You still haven &apos;t finished paying for your washing machine ?
There is a rock in my shoe .
This dog will protect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve master .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
Can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
It &apos;s unfor@@ gi@@ vable to date such a broken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side during this painful or@@ deal .
Look at this mess .
He is anything but a reliable man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
Sugar is soluble in water .
What do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
It &apos;s not enough to mem@@ orize the formul@@ as . You need to know how to use them .
What &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
What did you expect to happen ?
Maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is fluent in German , but with a s@@ light American accent .
She always expe@@ cts me to help her .
Go and speak to my colle@@ ague .
I do want to see you .
He was slain in battle .
Were you busy ?
Nobody &apos;s going to blame you .
I like cats .
Why don &apos;t you use a hammer ?
Can you still remember the time we first met ?
I reached the hilltop exactly at five .
It was tru@@ ly a miracle .
What &apos;s your final destination ?
Once upon a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
What are you going to do tonight ?
A book@@ keeper compu@@ tes all the company &apos;s income and expenses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
He has a video .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wondering .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can recommend this restaurant .
The employ@@ e@@ e was escor@@ ted off the pre@@ mises .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
Why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
Kate has been given an opportunity to play a major role in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
Show us the straight path .
He did what I told him to do .
Can you go to the office by train ?
The teacher was disappointed at my answer .
We ren@@ o@@ vated a house .
Who taught you French ?
You &apos;re the prettiest woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
Get out of bed .

You guys su@@ ck .

What language were they speaking ?
Never tell lies .

Do you want to bet on that ?
We made sacrifices .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve chosen her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kissed .

We &apos;d like separate che@@ cks .
Who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
We &apos;re crossing the border .

I &apos;m glad I invited you .
There is only one truth .
Man has a great capac@@ ity to adapt to environ@@ mental changes .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America .
I don &apos;t have much interest in cooking .
Tom asked me to be here .
You look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .

Come and keep me company .
Why are you pic@@ king a fight with me ?
His kindness touched my heart .

I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
What &apos;s your favorite skin care product ?
You can borrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in absolutely total agre@@ ement .
This car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
He made up the whole story .
You &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
Everybody needs to know this .
F@@ all is late this year .
They &apos;re on good terms with their neighbors .

No , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
Everyone is going to call me a liar .
The child was crying for her mother .
They ruined it .
They want peace .
Are we being charged with something ?

I was right on the spot when it happened .
Be punctual .

You look so pale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
That &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .

I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admire her efforts .
We can &apos;t get close to the enemy .
There are a lot of stars larger than our own Sun .
They aren &apos;t dumber than you .
Can &apos;t this wait until things are back to normal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
My mother is a very good cook .
Are you watching the presidential debate ?
You were right .
Now I am free .
Who spread these rum@@ ours ?
That was written by Taro Akagawa .
She made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you considered me a close friend .
Things will only get worse .
The girl is drinking tea .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
This is your fault .
She met him on the beach .
They arrived at the hotel .
Is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had gotten no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ pping off during the meeting .
H@@ aven &apos;t you eaten yet ?
Don &apos;t talk to me about religion .
Who is there ?

Put on your shoes . Let &apos;s go out for dinner .
You &apos;re faithful .
The train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
This show is stupid .
Write Spanish .
Don &apos;t even think of asking me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it sno@@ ws .
There &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
Your question is not re@@ levant to the subject .
She came to see me .

Your feet will lead you to where your heart is .
Can I see you in my office ?
The president proposed a new plan .
I know who didn &apos;t do what they were supposed to do .
It doesn &apos;t take very long .
You don &apos;t look so busy .

I persuad@@ ed my mother to lend me her car .
This bread is hard as a rock .

That &apos;s beside the point .
She baked a pie .
Tom seems young .
What does any of that have to do with me ?

The confusion beg@@ gars description .
Don &apos;t be in such a hurry .
He drinks too much coffee .
Maybe we should just give up .
I thought you were serious .
I &apos;ve done a really stupid thing .
How do you say that in French ?
Her new novel has become a best seller .
You gotta get more organized .
A mother kissed the child .
I &apos;ve got a ton of homework .
When Tom spoke , they all remained silent .
French is fascin@@ ating .
You &apos;re planning something , aren &apos;t you ?
You should listen to his advice .
Prices are double what they were ten years ago .
They &apos;re early .
Tom always had to win .
You should stop .
Tom pretended he had a gun .
As soon as I have it , I &apos;ll forward it to you .
This is for your protection .

In the Picasso Mus@@ eum in Paris , there are mar@@ velous paintings and drawings !
The U@@ .@@ S@@ . president &apos;s passport is black , not blue like an average citiz@@ en &apos;s .
This could have un@@ intended consequences .
Who does she think she is ?
Tom decl@@ ined to comment .
We have considered your proposal , and we have decided that we are not able to redu@@ ce the price .
C@@ anc@@ el that .
Those were his actu@@ al words .
We know where he is .
Repetition is the mother of all learning .
This car runs on alcohol .
Keep the dog out .
I like these chairs .
Are you coming in or not ?
I &apos;m about to go out .
You can &apos;t help him .
I remember the war@@ m@@ th of his arms .
Why are you really doing this ?
You &apos;re very clever .
I &apos;ll sleep on the futon .
Tom is not a hero .
You &apos;re blo@@ cking my view .
That &apos;s not good .
We could &apos;ve helped Tom .
Mary opened her pur@@ se and looked around in it .
I &apos;ve thought about it , and what we &apos;re doing is just not right , so let &apos;s break up after today .
You don &apos;t seem very pleased .
Why don &apos;t you see for yourself ?
Have you put on sunscreen ?
Let &apos;s play chess another time .

A kiss is the best way to keep silent while saying it all .
With this talisman , you can ward off any and all evil spiri@@ ts .

Tom has never danced with Mary .
I want to talk to her .
You ought to have been more careful .
They &apos;re just students .
I believed you .
Where exactly did you go ?
I have been silent for a long time .
I think he &apos;s happy .
Nobody can believe in you more than yourself .
You &apos;re resourceful .
Have you ever slipped on a banana pe@@ el ?
I &apos;ll probably come by cab .
She &apos;s inse@@ cure .
I &apos;m not invincible .
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the picnic with him .
Come over here and sit down .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
I bought a watch and an empty box .
He &apos;s ru@@ th@@ less .
I slept very well last night .
It is generally hard to adapt to living in a foreign culture .
R@@ even@@ ues are growing , but not as fast as costs .

This lake is private . F@@ ishing here is forbidden .
I could never do that .

Tom is worried sick about Mary .
I &apos;d like to gradu@@ ate next spring .
The goods were transported by ship .

She always arrives on time .
I have nothing to bo@@ ast about .
He is very angry .
As I turned the handle of the cr@@ ank@@ sh@@ af@@ t , the old trac@@ tor s@@ pu@@ t@@ tered to life .
A few serious problems remain .
The horse is neigh@@ ing .
I have finished .
Try to be more punctual from now on .
All major credit cards are accepted .
In England the wai@@ ter asked us , &quot; How much beer would you like , a half pint or a pint ? &quot; Having no idea how much that would be , we asked him to show us the glasses .
The scientists have not found any explanation for the myst@@ eri@@ ous phenomenon .
That &apos;s your half .

Tom came up with an ingenious idea .
The criti@@ cs shot us down .
Tom has to learn Japanese because he &apos;s going to Japan next year .
