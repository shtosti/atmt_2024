It &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
There were a lot of girls at the party .
Come to help me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of ghosts .
He is well @-@ liked .
I added his name to the list .
Thank you for your efforts .
I need to see you in my office .
The costs are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
Don &apos;t mess with me !
I feel very strongly about that .
She owes me money .
Can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
This little girl lives in Brazil .
I feel like someone just walked over my grave .
Give me chapter and verse .
Can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
Our garden produced an abundance of cabbages last year .
Why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t stand this hot weather .
Give us the details .
She witnessed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was trapped in a vicious circle .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s secrets .
You should be more careful the next time .
Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
It will be ready soon .
There &apos;s a comparatively large cinema complex inside the mall .
Who &apos;s hiding behind the curtain ?
Obviously , you volunteered .
See life in terms of power .
The weather is good .
Do you really want to win ?
Most of them urged him to take the job .
Sami came to give Layla her gift .
Nothing was funny .
I never loved you .
Let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is boring , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
We are living through a biodiversity crisis .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
Really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
He &apos;s working at his English .
They live on the floor beneath .
There is a pond in the middle of the park .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
She speaks too much .
No taxi stopped .
You must not stop on the hard shoulder to go to the toilet .
Something is wrong with the engine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets upset easily .
This man is a legend .
Enjoy your meal ! Did you already start ?
You &apos;re a snob .
I figured I could count on you .
We &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
May I put it down here ?
If Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
At what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .
She is always forgetting my phone number .
What has become of him since then ?
She doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
You would like it .
The price is reasonable .
Industries increasingly became geared for outer space .
She likes no one and no one likes her .
Just pretend you don &apos;t know me .
The name of my country is written without any article .
The industrialised world is used to using water profligately .
Thank you for your detailed explanation .
You &apos;re my hero , Sami .
My legs are weak .
She doesn &apos;t know the title of the book you &apos;re talking about .
Let &apos;s talk shop for a while .
She poured the milk into a bowl .
Run hot water into the bath .
She treated me badly .
May I have your order , please ?
The radio is a bit loud .
Mary is a yodeler .
He kept on laughing at me .
I could tell you about beekeeping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bore you .
Don &apos;t all speak at once .
It was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at furniture we can &apos;t afford .
He wants you to come home .
You &apos;re early .
I found the empty box .
She made him rich .
He was standing at the top of the mountain .
She leaned towards me .
This is what I wanted .
You remind me of myself when I was your age .
These pieces of furniture are not for sale .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
Please close the door behind you .
Have you made a list yet ?
Without oxygen , all animals would have disappeared long ago .
Why &apos;s Tom still here ?
We need money .
It &apos;s my fault , not yours .
No one is amused .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
While we were having tea , there was an earthquake .
Either they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
What is in your hands ?
We need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the market .
It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life .
He is responsible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re considering doing that .

Do you really think Tom is happy ?
You &apos;ve been infected .
There were six sheep in the field .
Are you thinking about getting a job ?

The street in front of my house is pretty narrow .
When are we going to leave ?
My brain is fried .
A new road is under construction .
Tom had a little accident .
They kept drinking .
Did you read it entirely ?
She &apos;s two years younger than him .
Our teacher often overlooked his name on the list .
Tom still owes me a lot of money .
Get the hell out my way !
Be careful !
The population of Japan is larger than that of New Zealand .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
The price rose .
The pain has lessened a little .
I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me .
Any chance you know where I put my keys ?
That &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
You &apos;re all set ?
That &apos;s absolute nonsense !
The teacher punished her students for using bad words .
How can you accuse me of such a thing ? I would never lay a hand on my child .
Tom is thirsty .
He has a Southern accent .
Don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
The problem is theirs .
In times of crisis one should never idealise the past .
You can &apos;t sit there .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the cab .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
We get together once a year .
That was Tom &apos;s cousin .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
No one has ever seen God .
Some teachers have a great effect on their students .
We &apos;re old friends .
We avoid talking about politics .
I am not available .
Do you believe in Christianity ?
None of these cars are mine .
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office .
You still have a lot to learn .
I want to get back .
I &apos;m sorry that I couldn &apos;t live up to your expectations .
You can go if you want to .
I am convinced that he is innocent .
Do all of you speak French ?
Is this wine from Argentina ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
There &apos;s no wind today .
There were no fences on the great plains .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I think it would have been a better shoot with a 10mm lens .
Genius is only one remove from insanity .
I &apos;m going to show you the photo .
Get rich !
Everything is going fine .
You may choose any book you like .
Girl as she was , Joan was not daunted at all .

He is too drunk to drive home .
Experience is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
Painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . When you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
How did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . The meeting completely slipped my mind .
Food is necessary for life .
That sounds good !
We chartered a bus .
Ask me again some other time .
I don &apos;t want to upset you .
I can &apos;t wait .
Recently the number of cars has greatly increased .
You &apos;ve omitted the preposition in this sentence .
Enjoy yourself to the fullest .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live .
Don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bored . Let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom intended to do that .
The firm has its head office in Osaka .
Today , I was with a friend at the swimming pool .
Tom put some oat milk in his coffee .
I made him sweep the floor .
I don &apos;t have those answers .
My daughter likes to play with dolls .
Have you ever been there ?
Are you through with your work ?
You can &apos;t just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant .
I thought that you were going to wait for me .
Can cats really see in the dark ?
One minute has sixty seconds .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s changed .

Keep your gun handy .

Tom woke up with heartburn .
He has written a letter .
Why are you worried ?
I don &apos;t remember mailing the letter .
Is all of this money yours ?

She didn &apos;t show up .
You seem happy .
There was no swelling .

I &apos;m not as afraid of heights as I used to be .
You &apos;ll be safe with her .
How long does it take by car ?
Can we get some help ?
You must take advantage of the opportunity .
I opened a bottle of red wine .
You have a great imagination .
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him .
She &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
You &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your plate .
I admit I was surprised .
When will you return ?
